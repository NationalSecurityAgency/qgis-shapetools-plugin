description=Shape Tools is a collection of geodesic shapes and tools. Create ellipse, line of bearing, points along a line of bearing, pie wedge, donut, arc wedge, star, ellipse rose, epicycloid, gear, hypocyloid, polyfoil, polygon, radial line, and heart shapes. Tools include "XY to Line" tool, densify lines and polygons along geodesic paths, geodesic line break, geodesic measuring and create a measurement layer, geodesic scale, rotate, flip and translate tools, and digitize points at an azimuth & distance tools.

about=Shape Tools is a collection of geodesic shapes and tools. Shape Tools is installed in the Vector menu.
    "Create Shapes" processes a point vector layer to create ellipses, arc wedges, pie wedges, donuts, lines of bearing, points along a line of bearing, ellipse roses, epicycloids, hypocyloids, polyfoils, polygons, radial lines, stars, and hearts based on the table's fields and other parameters.
    "XY to Line" uses pairs of coordinates from each record to create geodesic lines. 
    "Geodesic Line Break" breaks lines at the International Date Line. 
    "Geodesic Densifier" creates geodesic lines and polygons by adding additional vertices along geodesic paths within the shape. 
    "Geodesic distance & Time Decimation" remove points or vertices from a point or line layer using geodesic distances or time.
    "Geodesic Measure Tool" measures distances using the WGS 84 ellipsoid and includes the bearing or heading between points. It will even saves the measurements as a layer.
    "Geodesic Measurement Layer" converts a polygon or line layer a new layer with all geometries measured and labeled.
    "Geodesic Transformation Tool" can scale, rotate and translate any shape.
    "Geodesic flip & rotate tools" provide geodesic flip and rotation vector feature transformations.
    "Azimuth, Distance Digitizer" digitizes points based on a clicked point, an azimuth and distance or creates a geodesic line from a clicked point to an azimuth and distance.
    "Field Calculator Functions" provides geodesic functions in the field calculator.
